0.1a6 (2013-11-20)
------------------

  [markvl]


0.1a5 (2012-11-28)
------------------

- Load setMenuSize() in the template, instead of on document.ready.
  Otherwise you will see the menu in the wrong layout before it is
  styled correctly. [mirella]


0.1a4 (2012-11-26)
------------------

- Fix the fix of the small menu. The small menu stopped working when
  it was expanded and the windows was resized from small to big and
  back again.
  [markvl]


0.1a3 (2012-11-26)
------------------

- Small fix where the small menu is expanded when the window is
  resized from big to small.
  [markvl]


0.1a2 (2012-11-22)
------------------

- Add a configuration option to always use the small menu when there
  are more than X menu items. (So we can prevent overflowing the menu
  even on 'desktop' screens.)
  [markvl]

- Make the small version of the menu work: start with children
  collapsed (hidden) and expand (visible) when needed. First click
  expands, second click collapses.
  [markvl]

- Use a class to mark that a menu item has children. (And remove the
  hard coded greater than sign.)
  [markvl]

- Remove duplication from the menu templates by moving the complete
  <ul> structure to the menu_recurse template.
  [markvl]


0.1a1 (2012-11-15)
------------------

- Package created using templer
